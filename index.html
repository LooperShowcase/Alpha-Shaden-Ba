    <h1>Gymnastics is a type of sport that includes physical exercises requiring balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, artistry and endurance.[1] The movements involved in gymnastics contribute to the development of the arms, legs, shoulders, back, chest, and abdominal muscle groups. Gymnastics evolved from exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and from circus performance 
      <h1>  Etymology  </h1>
     <h4>The word gymnastics derives from the common Greek adjective γυμνός (gymnos),[4] by way of the related verb γυμνάζω (gymnazo), whose meaning is to "train naked", "train in gymnastic exercise", generally "to train, to exercise".[5] The verb had this meaning because athletes in ancient times exercised and competed without clothing.</h4>
